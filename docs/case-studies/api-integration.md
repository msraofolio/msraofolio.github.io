heading: APIs to Enable Application Connections

Well-documented APIs are the basis on which the entire world’s applications talk to each other. And the reason people seamlessly perform actions on the internet, such as banking and booking airline tickets.

Well-documented APIs help developers in companies dealing with data and data-driven services use APIs to connect stand-alone applications when information and processes must flow between the applications. Using APIs enables developers to work securely without exposing code and protected data while also bridging the gap between different stand-alone applications.
Several API applications are available in the market, such as, Postman, Prismatic, and Workato. Applications such as Postman act as a client talking to the API server.  
For example, a weather app on your phone would connect with the National Weather Service to display real-time weather data. In this case the weather app APIs connect with the National Weather Service API server to give you real-time weather updates.

While developers use APIs on a day-to-day basis, they also struggle with simple necessary tasks such as authentication, troubleshooting, and accurate API query formation. These challenges are brought on by poorly documented APIs.

## Poorly Documented APIs

Poorly documented APIs do not contain important information that developers need to execute API queries quickly and successfully.

### Missing Header Information

If the header information in API documentation do not contain accurate software versions, payload rate limits, and formats, developers craft wrong API requests that do not work.

Also authentication information is part of an API header, and if the header is incorrect, then authentication fails too.

### Incomplete Attributes or Parameters List

If the API documentation does not exhaustively list all the applicable parameters, then developers cannot fully use the capabilities of the API request.

### Missing Examples

Examples are very important to developers. It helps them to craft their own unique API query. Examples are useful to demonstrate the API capability in different environments and contexts. Without examples, developers are limited in their confidence to build a successful API query.

### Vague Error Messages

Vague error messages do not help developers in troubleshooting and fine tuning their APIs. Sufficient information can be added to the code or described in the API documentation.

## Solutions

There are many solutions to help developers exhaustively and successfully use APIs. These solutions range from better software development lifecycles, technical writing team awareness, and a harnessing Artificial Intelligence.

### Modifying Software Development Lifecycles

It is very common for API developers to hurriedly add content and parameters to the code. More time needs to be given to these developers to write more effective API code.

### Technical Writing Team Awareness

Technical writers can help immensely in improving usage of APIs. Testing APIs help writers understand what developers are looking for. And, enhancing the API documentation templates to include more sections, such as Error handling, Rate limits, Versioning, Workflows and use cases, and Changelogs will greatly ensure API documentation precision.

### Artificial Intelligence in the Code Building Process

Harnessing AI in the code building process saves time and effort in creating useful API documentation. AI can prompt effective templates, missing information, and automatically create descriptions for errors and parameters.

## Impact of Effective API Documentation

Documenting effective API documentation ensures that developers can harness APIs to perform extremely complicated integrations ensuring the internet of things can function well. Additionally, reduced customer support requests enable engineers to focus on more important functionality issues versus finding missing information.
