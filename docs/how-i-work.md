# How I Work  
### My Documentation Philosophy & Process

My work is grounded in a simple principle: **documentation should reduce cognitive load, accelerate understanding, and scale with the product.**

Below is how I approach every project — from APIs to internal tools to enterprise workflows.

---

## 🧠 1. Understand the System, Not Just the Feature
I start by mapping the system end-to-end:

- Architecture  
- Data flows  
- Dependencies  
- User journeys  
- Operational constraints  

This ensures the documentation is accurate, contextual, and future-proof.

---

## 🗺️ 2. Design the Information Architecture Early
I build content models that reflect real user workflows:

- Task-based organization  
- Clear entry points  
- Minimal branching  
- Progressive disclosure  

This reduces friction and helps users find what they need quickly.

---

## 🧪 3. Write with Developer Empathy
I focus on:

- Clear examples  
- Error-first explanations  
- Realistic scenarios  
- Consistent terminology  
- Avoiding assumptions about prior knowledge  

Good documentation anticipates confusion before it happens.

---

## 🔧 4. Use Docs-as-Code for Scale
My workflow includes:

- Git-based versioning  
- Markdown + Jekyll  
- Automated formatting  
- Linting and link checking  
- PR-based reviews  
- Reusable templates  

This keeps documentation maintainable and aligned with engineering workflows.

---

## 🤖 5. Leverage AI for Acceleration, Not Replacement
I use AI to:

- Summarize SME interviews and demos  
- Generate first-draft structures  
- Convert YAML/JSON into Markdown  
- Create tables, examples, and scaffolding  

But the final voice, accuracy, and structure always come from me.

---

## 🤝 6. Collaborate Early and Often
I work closely with:

- Engineers  
- PMs  
- Support  
- QA  
- Design  

Documentation is most effective when it’s integrated into the product lifecycle, not added at the end.

---

## 📈 7. Measure Impact
I track:

- Page views  
- Time on page  
- Support ticket trends  
- Search queries  
- Feedback from users and internal teams  

Documentation should evolve based on real usage.
