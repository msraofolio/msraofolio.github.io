# Portfolio

A curated selection of writing samples that demonstrate my range across technical, architectural, and user-facing documentation. Each piece reflects my focus on clarity, structure, and developer empathy.

- **API Integration Guide**  
  
  A comparison between poor API documentation and good API documentation.

  → [Commvault PowerShell Module](https://documentation.commvault.com/11.42/software/commvault_powershell_module.html)
 
  → [Commvault REST API Reference](https://documentation.commvault.com/11.42/software/rest_api_reference.html)
