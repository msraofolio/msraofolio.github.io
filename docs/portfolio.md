# Portfolio

A curated selection of writing samples that demonstrate my range across technical, architectural, and user-facing documentation. Each piece reflects my focus on clarity, structure, and developer empathy.

- **API Integration Guide**  
  A comparison between poor API documentation and good API documentation.  
  → [Read the case study](/case-studies/api-integration/)

- **SDK Guide**  
  Contributed the OpenText Documentum Content Management SDK in 2009 - 2013 called the Webtop Web Development Kit.

- **AI Assistant Documentation**
  Created a section to describe how to enable AI in enterprise applications and use it to perform actions. I received good feedback on this content from upper management.

- **Base-level Server Configurations**
  Authored and maintained content for base-level configurations dealing with backups and restores, among other features. I was responsible for maintaining and creating content in this section.

- **Cloud Resilience**
  Authored content to help customers make their data cloud resilient.

- **API & Integration Documentation**  
  Clear, scenario-driven guides that help developers build faster and with confidence. I worked on API and PowerShell documentation that enable developers to perform actions outside the application UI via the command line.

- **System Workflows & Architecture Overviews**  
  Translating complex internal systems into digestible, visual-first explanations.

- **Release Notes & Product Updates**  
  High-signal, low-noise updates that drive adoption and reduce support load.

- **Troubleshooting & Operational Guides**  
  Practical, actionable content in the form of quick-turnaround Knowledge Base articles.

- **SQL Server-related Backup and Restore Configuration**
  Most customers back up to SQL Server databases. I recently started creating and updating configuration procedures for SQL Server-related backups and restores.

- **Old LinkedIn article**
