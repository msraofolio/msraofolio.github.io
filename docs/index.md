### Senior Technical Writer · Docs-as-Code Specialist · AI-Driven Documentation

#Testing my Changes

I create clear, scalable, and user‑centered documentation for complex systems — from internal tools and APIs to enterprise SaaS platforms. My work blends technical depth, information architecture, and a strong focus on developer empathy.

My approach is shaped by:
- 15+ years in fintech, SaaS, and internal tooling  
- Deep experience embedding documentation into Agile workflows  
- A docs-as-code mindset grounded in Git, Markdown, and automation  
- A growing focus on AI-assisted documentation and content intelligence

## What I Do

- **API & Integration Documentation**  
  Clear, scenario-driven guides that help developers build faster and with confidence.

- **System Workflows & Architecture Overviews**  
  Translating complex internal systems into digestible, visual-first explanations.

- **Release Notes & Product Updates**  
  High-signal, low-noise updates that drive adoption and reduce support load.

- **Troubleshooting & Operational Guides**  
  Practical, actionable content that accelerates issue resolution.
