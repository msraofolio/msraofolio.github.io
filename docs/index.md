# About Me

I am a Senior Technical Writer with 15+ years of experience documenting enterprise software, AI platforms, and data management systems. As an expert in API documentation, server configuration, installation guides, and docs-as-code workflows, I create documentation that drives product adoption and reduces support costs across complex enterprise applications. I empathise with developers and collaborate across functional teams to deliver accurate documentation. More recently, I have been actively using AI to accelerate documentation workflows, improve content quality, and streamline collaboration between engineers and writers.

I am eager to take on a leadership role to support my professional growth and enhance the impact of documentation teams in companies.

She comes with a lot of passion for writing and does not publish her articles unless her work is perfect for the intended audience.
